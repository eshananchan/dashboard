Essentially, I was told I could not be helped because Yahoo doesn't offer the specific service I was asking about (Yahoo Local Listings) to businesses in my location (United States Virgin Islands).

Local search is fast becoming one of the primary drivers of customers to small businesses. Small businesses in US Territories, that depend on tourism to survive, but do not have the advertising budgets to compete with nationwide and international chains, are in critical need of inclusion in NAP databases that serve local search platforms. However, I have found that the databases that serve international (non-US) regions do not include the US Territories, because they consider the territories to be US locations, and the databases that serve domestic US regions (like Yahoo Local) exclude US Territories, because they consider the Territories international.

Felt her customer service and the way she addressed me/talked to me could've been better. Kind of felt like I was doing her a favor or like I was a burden, etc. She did help me though which I appreciated, just attitude wise, she could've been a little nicer or more engaging. Got smart with me a few times and I felt kind of slighted. Overall, ok. Also wish Yahoo hold times weren't so long. If there's going to be a long hold time, they should offer the option for customer to schedule a callback with a rep if the hold times are long.  asap. They can call people back if they get disconnected as my rep initially did, so I feel its only necessary to have a call back queue. Overall call was ok, just offering general advice and feedback.

Good Day,

I asked to discontinue the website lullianarts.net - not to pass it
on my credit card the 28th of January 15, I was told it will not
pass and you will cancel, but I received another letter telling me
to do this and that, I am not good with computer, and English
I am French. Confusing, I don't know if it will be renewed or not.
If you renew it, you will have to reimburse me, and that is a lot

It would be really nice to have a customer care representative that you could speak too.  NO where on your site could I find any phone number to call.  I strongly suspect that Yahoo could have solved my problem in a matter of minutes and I would have been a happy customer.  On the contrary - I feel like Yahoo does not really care about solving its customers problems.  I suspect they belive that once a customer has an email account then changing the email account is a bigger pain than dealing with the pain caused by Yahoo's lack of an easy to find and use customer service.,0,1

When I think of Yahoo and how I would describe it to others, one word comes to mind - inept.  It seems Yahoo is inept at even the simplest of tasks with Customer Care as a simple cut/paste response of click this or that which lead to nonsense and unhelpful, unrelated information.  I thought when Marissa took over that Yahoo might somehow grow up and be a professional organization, but sadly that isn't happening.  For anyone that cares (if anyone actually reads this that is), my dissatisfaction has to do with Yahoo Small Business.  After months of waiting for my business to be added to the Small Business Directory (and to this day -still not), I'm surprised any small business owner places their business in Yahoo's local directory.",0,1

Now... once I called in and spoke with someone... that went wonderfully.

Latest Update:
We couldn't say.  We don't have the listing that Yahoo is providing, so you will have to go back to them to ask who provided it and contact them to remove from their data feed to Yahoo.

Original Request:

Hi,
    Yahoo local has my information listed incorrectly.

&lt;https://local.yahoo.com/info-93003870-plus-minus-recording-pittsburgh&gt;

I already contacted them about removing or editing it.  They have not.  I 
edited my listing in your database a couple of months ago.  How can I go 
about getting it changed on yahoo's listing(question)

My problem was that our Basic Listing for Yahoo Local was denied because we ""didn't have a physical location."" This reason makes absolutely no sense as we do have a physical location which I had filled in on the Yahoo Local listing. This location is also listed on our website and any simple internet search would show that our address is at 6020 W. Donges Bay Rd. in Mequon Wisconsin. When I submitted this issue in an email to Yahoo, I only received a canned response from a customer service representative, Azmath, stating to ""review the reason provided in your account"" and that ""You can check the status of your listing on your My Businesses page.

Caring means you go into the account, and try to help fix the problem.

I did what the last agent asked for, and now the last email is asking for more information. It's taking much too long for the agents to perform a simple request. When requesting information, the agents need to word their requests clearly and in detail so there won't be any confusion about dual meanings and multiple interpretations. I believe some agents are simply rushing while addressing some of these issues, and the result is sometimes confusion and time loss for the client.

He seemed to look at maybe a couple of key words in my complaint, and then pick out a canned response that actually had nothing at all to do with what I described. Completely worthless waste of my time!!! I had to respond and ask someone to actually read my response and look at my account. Those things should be basic customer service, 101. The second one, Shirin, was at least a little more helpful. He gave me a phone number I can call. I still have a feeling that I'm being sent on a wild goose chase, and there are a few easy things he could have done to change me into a happy customer. But he did tell me where I could go start looking for the information, even if he didn't make sure that the information would actually be available for me. I'd give him maybe a 4 out of 10. Basically, if I were still deciding whether to stay with Yahoo for my domain business, this customer service experience has MORE than convinced ",0,1
